# Routes Folder

This folder contains Express route definitions for the API:

- `authRoutes.js`: Handles authentication (register, login).
- `postRoutes.js`: Handles post creation, retrieval, likes, and comments.
- `userRoutes.js`: Handles user profile retrieval and updates.

Routes map HTTP requests to controller logic.
