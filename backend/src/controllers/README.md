# Controllers Folder

This folder contains controller files that implement the logic for handling API requests:

- `authController.js`: Handles user registration and login.
- `postController.js`: Handles creating posts, fetching posts, liking, and commenting.
- `userController.js`: Handles user profile retrieval and updates.

Controllers interact with models and send responses to the client.
